This repository contains code and documentation for developing a Decision Tree Classifier to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The aim of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent activities in financial transactions. In addition to building the classifier, insights derived from the model will be used to develop an actionable plan for addressing fraudulent transactions.
# Dataset
