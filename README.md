# Fraudulent Transaction Detection
This repository contains code and documentation for developing a Decision Tree Classifier to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The aim of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent activities in financial transactions. In addition to building the classifier, insights derived from the model will be used to develop an actionable plan for addressing fraudulent transactions.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing transaction data. It has 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns. The dataset includes information such as transaction amount, merchant information, and whether the transaction was fraudulent or not.
# Packages
Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

# You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# Actionable Insights
After building the model, analyze its results to gain actionable insights into fraudulent transactions. Consider the following:

Identify the most important features that contribute to detecting fraud.
Explore the distribution of fraudulent transactions over time, merchants, or transaction amounts.

# Actionable Plan
Based on the insights gained from the model, create an actionable plan for addressing fraudulent transactions. This plan may include:

Real-time Monitoring: Implement real-time transaction monitoring to detect and flag potentially fraudulent transactions as they occur.

Enhanced Verification: Add an additional layer of verification for high-risk transactions, such as two-factor authentication or manual review.

Communication: Establish communication channels with customers to verify suspicious transactions.

Machine Learning Updates: Continuously update and retrain the model with new data to improve its accuracy in detecting new fraud patterns.

Collaboration: Collaborate with law enforcement agencies to report and investigate confirmed cases of fraud.
